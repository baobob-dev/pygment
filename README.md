# Pygment - Simplified paint

Small school project made with friends which is basically a very simplified paint, made in Python.

## Tools :

- Pen (supposed to be always black)
- Brush
- Eraser
- Color palette (supposed to be exclusively for the brush)
- Slider to set the scale of the pen, the brush and the eraser
